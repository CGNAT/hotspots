A method for finding hotspots of rearrangement breakpoints.

Version 1 developed by Dominik Glodzik accompanying the publication: 
A somatic mutational process recurrently duplicates germline susceptibility loci and tissue-specific super-enhancers in breast cancers (Glodzik et al, Nature Genetics, 2017)

Version 2 developed by Dominik Glodzik and Even Holth Rustad, making the functions generic and adding a full suite of utilities in order to perform similar analysis on independent datasets.
